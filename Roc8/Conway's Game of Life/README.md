# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

here are some rules of the game which are implemented to this game

#Rules
For a space that is populated:
Each cell with one or no neighbours dies, as if by solitude.
Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated.
