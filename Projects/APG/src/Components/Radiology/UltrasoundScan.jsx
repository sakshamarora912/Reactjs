      <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#5183a2]">What is an Ultrasound Scan?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg sm:text-base md:text-base mb-6">
        An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound waves) to create images of the internal organs and soft tissue structures. It is a commonly used imaging technique that helps doctors assess a wide variety of conditions. The ultrasound probe emits sound waves, which bounce back from the tissue and are converted into an image on the monitor. Ultrasound is useful in examining organs like the heart, liver, kidneys, uterus, and even blood vessels.

      <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-base mb-6">
        Ultrasound scans help doctors examine different parts of your body for conditions like gallstones, kidney stones, pregnancy-related issues, and more. It's commonly used for monitoring the fetus during pregnancy, checking for abnormalities, and assessing various internal organs.

      <h3 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#5183a2]">Ultrasound vs. Sonography</h3>
      <p className="text-base sm:text-base md:text-base mb-6">
        An ultrasound refers to the process of using sound waves to generate an image of the bodyâ€™s internal structures. A sonogram, on the other hand, is the actual image produced by the ultrasound. The terms are often used interchangeably, but sonography is the process, and the sonogram is the image.
